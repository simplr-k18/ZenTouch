# Zen Touch: The Path of Pure Action (Karma Yoga)

Welcome, traveler. This space, Zen Touch, is a digital pond for the soul. It is a tool for focused action and peaceful presence.

Here, the screen is the field of action, and your touch is the deed. You are invited to perform simple actions without attachment to the result, finding calm in the act itself.

## The Three Principles of Zen Touch

### 1. Action is the Ripple (Karma)

**The Deed:** To touch, click, or drag the screen is the action.

**The Result:** A calm, beautiful ripple radiates outward. The ripple fades, teaching the non-permanence of all things.

**The Practice:** Every touch is a moment of presence, a small offering of attention.

### 2. Sound is the Reflection (Nada Yoga)

**Generative Sound:** With each ripple, a soft note arises from a peaceful, fixed scale.

**The Message:** The sound confirms the action but is a whisper, not a command. It is the echo of your deed in the universe.

**The Practice:** Listen, but do not crave the sound. Let the gentle notes guide you to stillness.

### 3. The Themes are the States of Being (Gunas)

Just as the world changes, so too can the visual mood of your practice. Choose the state that best serves your current reflection:

* **Midnight:** For quiet introspection and deep calm.
* **Sunrise:** For gentle warmth and hope.
* **Forest:** For earthy stillness and tranquility.

## How to Enter the State of Zen Touch

1. **Open the Gate:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. **Awaken the Senses:** The first touch enables the sound—the ear is opened.
3. **Perform the Action:** Touch or drag the screen. Create and witness the ripple.
4. **Be Present:** This is the practice. Simply touch, observe, and let go.

Find your focus in the ripple. Be free from the need to grasp.
